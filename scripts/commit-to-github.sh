git commit -m "üöÄ Add GitHub Codespaces support for Intelligence OS Platform

‚ú® Features Added:
- Complete GitHub Codespaces configuration
- Cloud-optimized Docker setup for resource efficiency
- Simplified deployment scripts for quick startup
- Comprehensive documentation and setup guides
- Lightweight backend with minimal dependencies
- Fast Docker builds optimized for cloud deployment

üõ† Technical Improvements:
- .devcontainer/devcontainer.json with full VS Code setup
- docker-compose.fast.yml for efficient cloud deployment
- Minimal requirements.txt to avoid timeout issues
- Automated setup scripts for seamless onboarding
- Port forwarding configuration for all services
- Environment-specific configurations

üìö Documentation:
- README-CODESPACE.md with detailed setup instructions
- Comprehensive main README.md with architecture overview
- Quick start scripts and troubleshooting guides

üéØ Benefits:
- Zero local resource usage - everything runs in GitHub's cloud
- 2-4 CPU cores + 8GB RAM in Codespace (more than most local setups)
- Automatic HTTPS URLs for secure access
- Pre-configured development environment
- Persistent cloud storage
- Access from any device with a browser

This setup completely frees up local Mac resources while providing
a powerful, cloud-based development environment for the Intelligence OS Platform!"
