# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligence OS Meeting Intelligence Platform is a comprehensive AI-powered system that implements the Oracle 9.1 Protocol's six-dimensional analysis framework for organizational wisdom development. This platform transforms meetings into actionable intelligence through sophisticated AI orchestration, voice-first interfaces, and real-time collaborative analysis.

The system serves as a complete development kit for building enterprise-grade meeting intelligence solutions that enhance collaborative effectiveness and organizational wisdom development through AI-human collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversation occurs THEN the system SHALL assess fulfillment of the six fundamental human needs (Certainty, Variety, Significance, Connection, Growth, Contribution)
2. WHEN need imbalances are detected THEN the system SHALL identify overemphasis patterns and unhealthy fulfillment approaches
3. WHEN need conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL map interactions between competing or conflicting needs
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate specific intervention strategies for individual and team development
5. WHEN personal data is processed THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate privacy protections and ethical boundaries

### Requirement 6: Strategic Framework Integration

**User Story:** As a strategic planner, I want the system to assess organizational alignment with multiple strategic frameworks so that I can understand how meeting outcomes connect to broader organizational objectives and sustainability goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strategic analysis runs THEN the system SHALL evaluate alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
2. WHEN framework assessment occurs THEN the system SHALL analyze alignment with Doughnut Economy principles
3. WHEN strategic synthesis happens THEN the system SHALL assess compatibility with The Agreement Economy framework
4. WHEN alignment scoring is complete THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for enhancing strategic alignment
5. WHEN multiple frameworks conflict THEN the system SHALL identify synergies and optimization opportunities

### Requirement 7: External System Integration Hub

**User Story:** As an organization, I want the platform to integrate seamlessly with our existing tools so that meeting intelligence enhances our current workflows without requiring system replacement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Zapier integration is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically process meeting transcripts delivered in Markdown, Text, or JSON formats
2. WHEN Notion integration is active THEN the system SHALL maintain bidirectional sync with all required databases (Decisions, Actions, Meetings, Insights, Solutions, Human Needs)
3. WHEN Dart integration is enabled THEN the system SHALL create and update action items with appropriate project tags and priorities
4. WHEN Git integration is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically commit outputs with proper version control and collaboration support
5. WHEN integration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Output Generation

**User Story:** As a meeting stakeholder, I want detailed, structured outputs from every meeting so that I can access executive summaries, action items, strategic implications, and development recommendations in standardized formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN meeting analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate Executive Summary with all required subsections
